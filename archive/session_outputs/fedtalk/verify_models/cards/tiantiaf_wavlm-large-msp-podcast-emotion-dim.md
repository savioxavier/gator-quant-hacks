# wavlm-large for Dimensional Emotion Classification

# Model Description
This model includes the implementation of dimensional emotion classification described in Vox-Profile: A Speech Foundation Model Benchmark for Characterizing Diverse Speaker and Speech Traits (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14648)

The training pipeline used is also the top-performing solution (SAILER) in INTERSPEECH 2025—Speech Emotion Challenge (https://lab-msp.com/MSP-Podcast_Competition/IS2025/). 
Note that we did not use the transcript compared to our official challenge submission system, and we created a speech-only system to make the model simple but still effective.

We use the MSP-Podcast data to train this model, noting that the model might be sensitive to content information when making emotion predictions. However, this could be a good feature for classifying emotions from online content.


The outputs are in the range of 0-1 for: 
<pre>
Arousal (0 calm, 1 active), 
Valence (0 negative, 1 positive), 
Dominance (0 weak, 1 strong)
</pre>

# How to use this model

## Download repo
```
git clone git@github.com:tiantiaf0627/vox-profile-release.git
```
## Install the package
```
conda create -n vox_profile python=3.8
cd vox-profile-release
pip install -e .
```

## Load the model
```python
# Load libraries
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from src.model.emotion.wavlm_emotion_dim import WavLMWrapper
# Find device
device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
# Load model from Huggingface
model = WavLMWrapper.from_pretrained("tiantiaf/wavlm-large-msp-podcast-emotion-dim").to(device)
model.eval()
```

## Prediction
```python    
# Load data, here just zeros as the example
# Our training data filters output audio shorter than 3 seconds (unreliable predictions) and longer than 15 seconds (computation limitation)
# So you need to prepare your audio to a maximum of 15 seconds, 16kHz and mono channel
max_audio_length = 15 * 16000
data = torch.zeros([1, 16000]).float().to(device)[:, :max_audio_length]
arousal, valence, dominance = model(data)
```
