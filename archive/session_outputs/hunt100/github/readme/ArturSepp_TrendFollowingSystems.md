**Documentation:** the [trendfollowing handbook](https://trendfollowingsystems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
develops every result below chapter by chapter (filters, normalisation, processes, the P&L
identity, the closed-form Sharpe ratio, costs, skewness and the three systems), with worked
examples that the test suite executes and an API reference grouped by chapter.

`trendfollowing` implements the paper's central result: an exact decomposition
of the European trend-following system's P&L into an autocorrelation channel
and a squared-drift channel,

```math
\bar F_{1y} = h \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \nu^{m}\rho(m)
+ \frac{l \sigma_{\mathrm{target}}}{\sqrt{a}} \mu^{2},
\qquad h = l \sigma_{\mathrm{target}} \sqrt{a} \frac{1-\nu}{\nu}
```

where $\rho(m)$ is the autocorrelation function of volatility-normalised
returns, $\mu$ their annualised drift, and $\nu$ the filter smoothing parameter
of the span. The annualised Sharpe ratio follows in closed form for any causal
linear process, with the excess kurtosis of the innovations entering through a
single loading. On 84 liquid futures contracts, the closed form applied to
sample moments reproduces the realised Sharpe ratios of the European system
with a pooled correlation of 0.99 and a regression slope of 0.96.

## Why trendfollowing

### Key differentiators

The package is useful when three things matter:

- You want to **select the filter span analytically** rather than by grid
  search: the AR-1 break-even cost is nearly span-invariant
  ($c^{*}_{\infty} = \sqrt{\pi/2a} \phi/(1-\phi)$, 37–41bp at $\phi = 0.05$),
  while ARFIMA long memory creates an interior cost-optimal span — two regimes
  the closed forms separate cleanly.
- You want to **predict a contract's trend-following Sharpe ratio from its
  autocorrelation function and drift** before running a backtest, and to
  attribute realised performance to trend, mean reversion, and drift.
- You want **three reference system implementations** — continuous EWMA-filter
  weights, binary crossover positions with ATR stops, and sign-based time
  series momentum — that run out of the box on the packaged dataset, net of
  volume-based costs, with portfolio volatility targeting.

The analytics layer is pure numpy/scipy: every formula is a function you can
read. The backtest layer builds on [`qis`](https://github.com/ArturSepp/QuantInvestStrats).

## When to use it — and when not

The package is useful when selecting the filter span analytically rather than by grid search,
predicting a contract's trend-following Sharpe ratio from its autocorrelation function and drift
before running a backtest, or using the three reference system implementations.

It is a research and replication library, not a broker integration or general-purpose execution
engine; portfolio analytics and reporting are delegated to `qis`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install trendfollowing
```

Python >= 3.10 and `qis` >= 5.0.9. The analytical layer and the Monte Carlo
verification run without any data. Wheels and source checkouts include the
empirical dataset (84 futures contracts, benchmarks, volume-based costs;
1959–2026).

### Development installation

For an editable checkout with the test and lint tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArturSepp/TrendFollowingSystems.git
cd TrendFollowingSystems
uv sync --locked --group test --group lint
```

<a id="quickstart"></a>

## Five-minute quickstart

The authoritative first-success script is repository-only, so run it from a cloned checkout:
[`examples/quickstart.py`](https://github.com/ArturSepp/TrendFollowingSystems/blob/main/examples/quickstart.py).
It uses only the installed top-level API to compute deterministic AR(1) and ARFIMA closed forms:

```console
python examples/quickstart.py
```

It prints the installed version, AR(1) Sharpe `0.200195`, ARFIMA(0,d,0) Sharpe `0.288820`, and
the 260-day annualization, zero-drift, and single-EWMA conventions. It runs without network or
data access, writes no files, and points to `PHI`, `D`, and `LONG_SPAN` as the first parameters
to change. The [documentation quickstart](https://trendfollowingsystems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
includes the same file mechanically.

A portfolio backtest of the paper's LS(250,20) filter on the packaged universe:

```python
from trendfollowing.universe import load_data
from trendfollowing.systems.european import run_european_tf_system

prices, volume_costs, benchmark_prices, descriptive_df, group_order = load_data()
outputs = run_european_tf_system(prices=prices,
                                 long_span=250,
                                 short_span=20,
                                 vol_span=33,                  # volatility estimator span, days
                                 portfolio_covar_span=63,      # portfolio-level volatility targeting
                                 portfolio_target_vol=0.15,
                                 volume_costs=volume_costs,
                                 warmup_period=250)
nav = outputs.portfolio_pnl_net                                # compounded nav, net of costs
```

Net of volume-based costs and gross of fees, this configuration delivers a
Sharpe ratio of 1.10 at a 15.2% realised volatility over 1960–2026
([`examples/backtest_european_system.py`](examples/backtest_european_system.py)).

## The three systems

**European** ([`systems/european.py`](src/trendfollowing/systems/european.py)):
continuous weights from a variance-preserving EWMA filter, single or
long-short, applied to volatility-normalised returns, with volatility-targeted
position sizing. The system of the closed forms.

**American** ([`systems/american.py`](src/trendfollowing/systems/american.py)):
binary positions from the crossover of two price EWMA filters with an ATR
entry buffer and ATR trailing stop-losses, in the tradition of the turtle
systems. Position size is fixed at trade inception.

**TSMOM** ([`systems/tsmom.py`](src/trendfollowing/systems/tsmom.py)): the
normalised sum of signs of volatility-normalised period returns, generalising
Moskowitz–Ooi–Pedersen time series momentum to a period length L and lookback
of M periods.

At matched lookbacks the three systems correlate at 80% on average with the SG
Trend Index and deliver statistically indistinguishable Sharpe ratios by the
Ledoit–Wolf test: 0.47, 0.50, and 0.55 against 0.47 for the SG Trend Index, on
monthly returns net of costs and 2/20 fees. The European closed form therefore
ranks the performance of all three designs.

## Closed-form results

For volatility-normalised returns with autocorrelation function $\rho(m)$ and
annualised drift $\mu$, the annualised Sharpe ratio of the European system is

```math
SR = \frac{\sqrt{a} A_{\nu} + \mu^{2}/\sqrt{a}}
{\sqrt{B_{\nu} + A_{\nu}^{2} + \kappa K_{\nu} + (\mu^{2}/a)(1 + B_{\nu} + 2A_{\nu})}}
```

closed-form under any causal linear process, with the excess kurtosis $\kappa$
of the innovations entering through the single loading $K_{\nu}$. Under trading
costs per unit of volatility-normalised turnover, the net Sharpe ratio follows
at leading order from an independence-based signal-turnover proxy, and the
ARFIMA autocorrelation generating function is the Gauss hypergeometric
function $F(d, 1, 1-d; \nu)$. `trendfollowing.analytics` implements all of the
above:

- `sharpe.compute_annualised_sharpe(rho, long_span, short_span, sr_underlying)` — the generic formula
- `sharpe.compute_realized_sharpe(returns, af, ddof)` — the canonical estimator $\sqrt{a} \hat E[f_t]/\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{Var}}[f_t]}$, equal to `qis.compute_sharpe_arithmetic` (guarded in the tests)
- `sharpe.sharpe_ar1`, `sharpe.compute_kurtosis_loading`, `sharpe.compute_signal_moments` — per-process forms and loadings
- `autocorrelation.population_acf(n_lags, phi, d)` — white noise, AR(1), ARFIMA(0,d,0), ARFIMA(1,d,0) (Sowell 1992)
- `expected_return.expected_pnl_*`, `expected_return.expected_turnover` — expected return and turnover per process

The closed forms are exact rather than fitted, and Monte Carlo confirms them
process by process. The figure below is Figure 6.3 of the paper: the expected
annual return, the gross Sharpe ratio, and the net Sharpe ratio of the European
system under the ARFIMA process with long memory $d = 0.02$ and AR-1 feature
$\phi \in \{-0.05, 0, 0.05\}$, with the analytic values as lines and the Monte
Carlo estimates as markers.

![ARFIMA process: analytic closed forms against Monte Carlo](papers/tf_systems/paper/figures/expected_return_arfima1.PNG)

Analytic and Monte Carlo values agree at every span. The net Sharpe ratio in
panel (C) attains an interior cost-optimal span, which long memory creates and
the AR-1 process does not, because there the cost-optimal span diverges at the
break-even cost.

## Skewness of aggregated returns

Trend-following returns acquire positive skewness under time aggregation with no
drift and no predictability. The daily return multiplies the lagged signal by the
current return, so the $T$-day cumulative return loads on the realised
autocovariance of the volatility-normalised returns, which makes it a convex
payoff on the realised trend. Under white noise the skewness is available in
closed form,

```math
\varsigma(T) = \frac{6\nu \left( T(1-\nu^{2}) - 1 + \nu^{2T} \right)}
{(1-\nu^{2})^{3/2} T^{3/2}}
```

which is zero at one day, positive at every horizon beyond one day, and peaks
near half the filter span.

![Skewness of aggregated trend-following returns](papers/tf_systems/paper/figures/aggregated_skewness.PNG)

Figure 7.5 of the paper: panel (A) is the closed form across filter spans with
Monte Carlo markers, panel (B) is Monte Carlo under white noise, AR(1), and
ARFIMA at the span of 100 days, and panel (C) is the empirical profile across the
84 futures contracts, whose median attains 2.33 at the horizon of 55 days against
the closed-form 2.35 and whose interquartile range stays positive at every
horizon. The right tail of trend-following returns is structural: it requires no
forecasting skill, because it holds exactly where the expected return is zero.
`analytics.skewness.skewness_white_noise(horizon, span)` implements the formula.

## Empirical illustration

The figure below is Figure 7.3 of the paper: the Sharpe ratio of the European
system predicted from each contract's sample autocorrelation function and
drift, against the realised backtest Sharpe ratio, across 84 futures contracts
and the paper's span grid.

![Predicted versus realised Sharpe ratios across 84 futures contracts](papers/tf_systems/paper/figures/tf_prediction_scatter.png)

The pooled correlation is 0.99 and the regression slope 0.96 for the European
system, 0.89 and 0.73 for TSMOM, and 0.92 and 0.61 for the American system at
spans above one month. The practical content: two sample moments of a
contract's volatility-normalised returns — its autocorrelation function and
its drift — carry nearly all the information a trend-following backtest on
that contract produces. Span selection, contract screening, and performance
attribution can run on the closed form directly, and the same formula prices
the trade-off that costs impose: at realistic futures costs of 40–60bp per
unit of volatility-normalised turnover, a short-memory AR-1 alpha at
$\phi = 0.05$ sits below its 37–41bp break-even at every span, while long-memory
alpha survives at the one-to-three-month cost-optimal spans.

You can reproduce the per-contract exercise in three lines
([`examples/predict_sharpe_from_acf.py`](examples/predict_sharpe_from_acf.py)):
ES1 predicts 0.227 against a realised 0.206, and Corn predicts 0.625 against
0.620.

The three systems also run out of the box on the packaged dataset. The figure
below is Figure 7.2 of the paper: the European, American, and TSMOM systems net
of volume-based costs against the SG Trend Index, with the cumulative
performance, the running drawdown, and the one-year EWMA correlations.

## Examples

Self-contained usage cases in [`examples/`](examples/), each runnable directly:

- [`analytic_sharpe_vs_span.py`](examples/analytic_sharpe_vs_span.py) — the
  closed-form gross and net Sharpe ratios across spans: the AR-1 knife edge
  (the cost decides the sign at every span) and the ARFIMA interior optimum.
  Runs without data.
- [`backtest_european_system.py`](examples/backtest_european_system.py) — the
  LS(250,20) portfolio backtest on the packaged 84-contract universe with
  volume-based costs and portfolio volatility targeting.
- [`predict_sharpe_from_acf.py`](examples/predict_sharpe_from_acf.py) — the
  attribution exercise in miniature: predict the per-contract Sharpe ratio
  from the sample autocorrelation function and drift, and compare with the
  realised backtest on the same sample.

## Reproducing the paper exhibits

One entry point reproduces every figure, driven by the `PaperFigure` enum:

```bash
python -m papers.tf_systems.replication.reproduce_all_figures
```

Nine frozen caches in `papers/tf_systems/replication/data/reference/` support
the three process figures and two attribution figures. Render those with
`python -m papers.tf_systems.replication.cached_figures`; full regeneration above
also runs expensive simulations and data-dependent stages. New output goes to
the external paper runtime. Table 6.1 needs separate generated simulation parts.
See [`papers/tf_systems/README.md`](papers/tf_systems/README.md) for commands,
the figure map and verification catalogue. The approved manuscript source and
figures are tracked; the reading PDF remains local.

## Data

The dataset installed under `trendfollowing/resources/futures` contains the
daily prices and USD returns of the 84 futures contracts used in the paper
(July 1959 to July 2026), the benchmark series, the volume-based cost schedule,
and the instrument metadata. The universe covers the most liquid contracts
across global equity, bond, short-rate, currency, and commodity markets. The
continuous series are constructed so that their relative returns carry no
roll-related jumps and equal the excess returns of the held contract.
`trendfollowing.universe.load_data()` resolves these files through package
resources; set `TF_RESOURCE_PATH` to override them with an external folder.

## Sharpe convention

All Sharpe ratios of the theory, the attribution, and the report exhibits are
annualised arithmetic means over annualised volatility of periodic simple
excess returns, $SR = \sqrt{a}\cdot\text{mean}/\text{std}$ — the convention of
equation (5.1) of the paper, computed by the shared estimator
`trendfollowing.compute_realized_sharpe`. The regime-conditional Sharpe ratios
route through the qis `SharpeConvention.ARITHMETIC` switch at the manuscript's
one-sigma 16/84 quantiles, where the bear, normal, and bull contributions sum
to the total Sharpe exactly. See `qis/docs/sharpe_conventions.md` for the
decision record.

## Verification

`papers/tf_systems/replication/` carries the verification scripts behind the
manuscript's claims: the boundary term of the sample-path identity, the
Appendix C asymptotics, the GARCH pipeline and ARFIMA truncation checks, and a
Monte Carlo regression test of the long-short normalisation and the turnover
closed form.

```bash
cd papers/tf_systems/replication && PYTHONPATH=../../.. python verify_ls_normalization.py
```

## Tests

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest
