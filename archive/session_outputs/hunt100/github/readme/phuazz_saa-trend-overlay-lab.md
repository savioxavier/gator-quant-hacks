# SAA Trend-Overlay Lab

A backtest of the Faber 10-month trend overlay applied to a nine-block
strategic asset allocation, on spliced long-history total-return series from
Norgate. Two questions: (1) does the overlay concept hold over long history,
pre-ETF-era; (2) does a **per-asset** overlay across the SAA building blocks
beat a **single overlay on the balanced base** (the operational-ease choice)
and the plain diversified base.

**Educational research, not investment advice.** Personal context.

## Status — WS0→WS2 complete; dashboard built

- **WS0 data layer, WS1 (long-history concept), WS2 (per-asset vs single): done.**
  14 pytest green. Deep sleeves reach 1962–1996; per-asset-vs-single spans 2004–2026.
- **Verdict: KEEP the single overlay (C).** The overlay concept is real and
  predates the ETF era (WS1 — drawdown roughly halved on every sleeve; proxy-era
  Sharpe 0.74 REIT / 0.55 commodity / 0.43 Long Treasuries). Per-asset (D/E) does
  NOT robustly beat C (WS2): E clears the frozen +0.10 Sharpe bar only at ≤10 bps
  under equal weight; under an inverse-vol base C rises to 0.71 and the per-asset
  edge vanishes — per-asset is a substitute for risk-balanced weighting. The
  bigger, robust lever is inverse-vol weighting of the base.
- **Dashboard:** `template.html` → `docs/index.html` (educational; derived
  overlay states only, per the Norgate personal-use licence).

## Universe (9 SAA building blocks)

US equity (SPY), Dev ex-US (EFA), EM (EEM), Long Treasuries (TLT), Interm
Treasuries (IEF), REITs (VNQ), Broad commodity (DBC), Gold (GLD), Cash/3m-bill
(BIL). Each is a pre-ETF proxy chained on returns to the ETF, except the two
international blocks, held as EFA/EEM outright (amendment A1). See the
reconciliation table in `PRE_REGISTRATION.md`.

## Data

Norgate Data (`norgatedata`, local NDU). **Personal-use licence: never publish
vendor series values on any public page — only derived overlay states.**
Proxies: `$SPXTR`, `$DWRTFT`, `$BCOMTR` (TR indices), `XAUUSD` (gold spot),
EFA/EEM (ETF bridges), and two clearly-labelled SYNTHETIC series — a
constant-maturity par-bond TR from `%30YTCM`/`%10YTCM` and a T-bill TR from
`%IRX`. No proxy is trusted before its overlap reconciliation to the ETF.

```

## Last updated

2026-07-05 — WS0→WS2 complete, dashboard built (verdict: keep C; inverse-vol is the lever).
