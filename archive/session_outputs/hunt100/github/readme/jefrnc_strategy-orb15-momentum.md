# 🔥 ORB Trading System

**Professional algorithmic trading system for Interactive Brokers**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This system requires real market data from Polygon.io for backtesting. All performance metrics must be generated from your own backtests with actual historical data.

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### Core Strategy: Opening Range Breakout (ORB)
- **ORB Period**: Configurable (5-15 minutes)
- **Trading Window**: Morning session focus
- **Position Type**: Long only (breakout above ORB high)
- **Markets**: Large cap stocks (NVDA, TSLA, AMD, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META)

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Risk-based (configurable 1-5% per trade)
- **Stop Loss**: ATR-based or percentage
- **Take Profit**: Multiple R targets
- **Circuit Breakers**: Daily loss limits and drawdown protection

## 📋 System Requirements

### Software Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Core Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Interactive Brokers**: TWS or IB Gateway
- **Market Data**: Polygon.io API key (required for backtesting)

- **API Permissions**: Enable in TWS/Gateway settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jefrnc/strategy-orb15-momentum.git
cd strategy-orb15-momentum

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv orb_env
source orb_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Polygon API key
```

### 2. Paper Trading

## 📊 Backtesting with Real Data

### IMPORTANT: Real Data Required
This system does NOT include historical market data. You must use your own Polygon.io API key to fetch real market data for backtesting.

### Running Real Backtests
```bash
# Set your Polygon API key
export POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here

# Run backtest for specific period
python3 backtest_real_polygon_yearly.py --start-year 2024 --start-month 1 --end-year 2024 --end-month 12

# Results will be saved to data/yearly_backtest_results/
```

### Backtest Output
- `monthly_results.json` - Month-by-month performance
- `ytd_metrics.json` - Year-to-date statistics
- `all_trades.csv` - Individual trade details
- `backtest_summary.md` - Performance report

## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimers

### CRITICAL WARNINGS
1. **Paper Trade First**: Minimum 30-60 days paper trading required
2. **No Performance Guarantees**: Past results do not predict future performance
3. **Real Money Risk**: You can lose your entire investment
4. **Your Own Analysis**: Run your own backtests with real data
5. **Start Small**: Begin with conservative position sizing (1%)
